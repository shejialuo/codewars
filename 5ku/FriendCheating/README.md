# Is my friend cheating?

+ A friend of mine takes the sequence of all numbers from 1 to n (where n > 0).
+ Within that sequence, he chooses two numbers, a and b.
+ He says that the product of a and b should be equal to the sum of all numbers in the sequence, excluding a and b.
+ Given a number n, could you tell me the numbers he excluded from the sequence?
